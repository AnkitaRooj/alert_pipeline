Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\n\\nNestle said Thursday it will cut 16,000 jobs as the firm's new CEO, Philipp Navratil, looks to accelerate a turnaround at the consumer goods giant.\\n\\nIn a bid to improve operational efficiency, the firm said it will cut 12,000 white-collar jobs and a further 4,000 roles will be reduced over the next two years.\\n\\n\\\"We are transforming how we work,\\\" Navratil wrote in a LinkedIn post summarizing the company's earnings report. \\\"We are evolving and will simplify our organization and automate our processes.\\\"\\n\\nIt's unclear how Nestle plans to incorporate more automation into its corporate offices, but company spokesperson Chiara Valsangiacomo told CNBC that the initiative is \\\"much broader\\\" than replacing roles with artificial intelligence. Other companies, primarily in the tech sector, have slashed jobs as they turn to AI to replace human labor. So far this year, more than 17,000 job losses have been specifically tied to AI, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\\n\\nShares of Nestle closed 9.3% higher on Thursday. The stock price jump boosted Europe's food and beverage sector, which was up more than 4.2% at the end of the session.\\n\\nUnder its former CEO, Laurent Freixe, Nestle had already announced a cost-savings program worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.14 billion). This has now been accelerated to 3 billion francs by the end of 2027.\\n\\nThe company posted a better-than-expected organic growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter as it battles an uncertain consumer outlook amid U.S. tariffs and an increase in raw material prices, such as cocoa and coffee beans.\\n\\nNotably, real internal growth, or RIG, returned to positive territory in the third quarter \\u2014 up 1.5% \\u2014 as the maker of Nespresso and KitKat saw growth investments pay off, also helped by easier comparisons.\",\n          \"Apps can add flexibility and freshness to your routine. Just try not to get injured.\",\n          \"The TSMC logo is displayed on a building in Hsinchu, Taiwan April 15, 2025.\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Thursday reported a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit from last year, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.\\n\\nHere are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:\\n\\nRevenue: 989.92 billion New Taiwan dollars ($33.10 billion) vs. NT$977.46 billion expected\\n\\n989.92 billion New Taiwan dollars ($33.10 billion) vs. NT$977.46 billion expected Net income: NT$452.3 billion, vs. NT$417.69 billion\\n\\nTSMC's revenue in the September quarter rose 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion, also beating estimates. Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time.\\n\\nAs Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and AMD .\\n\\n\\\"Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,\\\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said on an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. \\\"Thus, our conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,\\\" he added.\\n\\nBolstered by this AI strength, Wei said the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.\\n\\nTSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 36,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.newsfilecorp.com/newsinfo/271056/208&quot; id=&quot;208&quot; width=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 1px;  height: 1px;border: 0px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;nfSubHeading&quot;&gt;Midnight Sun Shares Now Trading on the OTCQX Best Market in the United States under the symbol &quot;MDNGF.&quot;Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 20, 2025) - Midnight...\",\n          \"The third-quarter earnings season got off to a strong start.
